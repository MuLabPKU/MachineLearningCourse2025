This folder contains unofficial latex-written notes from last year's excellent student, Taoyu Yang. You can open them using local markdown readers or chrome/edge extensions like Markdown Viewer (remember to enable `mathjax` in content to display equations).

Note that, these notes are far from complete. They lack figures, some explanations, as well as verbal insights that can hardly be written down. I highly recommend you take notes yourself during the class. It is a great excercise to test whether you really understand the logics. Only refer to these notes when you were lost in some parts during class.

Finally, we welcome modifications to these unofficial notes (such as adding figures, more detailed explanations, correcting typos, etc.). Please raise an issue about what you want to add and submit a pull request. We will review it at our earliest convenience. Let's make the course better and better together!
